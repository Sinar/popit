The [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)-based
API allows you to easily access and edit all the data stored in PopIt from your
code or other websites.

There is a version string in the API url, currently 'v0.1'. This will be
updated if the API undergoes significant changes that breaks backwards
compatibility.

When you make a query the returned data will always be a hash. There will be a
result key that contains the data you've requested.

If something goes wrong there will be an 'error' or 'errors' key that will
explain the error. Often an HTTP error code will also be used (eg '404' if a
result cannot be found).

### ObjectIds and slugs

Objects in PopIt are always identified in the API by their id - if this is
generated by the database, it will be a 24-character hex string.

    /api/v0.1/persons/4f99219333fa2efc68000006

ObjectIds should not change. You can use your own IDs if you prefer and add
objects via the API.

### JSONP

Read (GET) requests to the API can have an optional `callback` parameter which will cause [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) to be returned. This might be useful if querying the API from a browser  on another website.
