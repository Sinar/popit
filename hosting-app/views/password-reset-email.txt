We heard that you lost your PopIt password. Sorry about that!

But don't worry! You can use the following link within the next day to reset your password:

{{password_reset_link}}

If you don't use this link within 24 hours, it will expire. To get a new password reset link, visit {{config.hosting_site_base_url}}/password-reset.

Thanks,
The PopIt team
